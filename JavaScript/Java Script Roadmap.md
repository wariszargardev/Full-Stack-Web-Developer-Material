# JavaScript Learning Roadmap

This document outlines a structured plan for learning JavaScript, from the fundamentals to advanced topics.

## Phase 1: Foundations (Understanding the Core)

1.  **Variables and Data Types:**
    * What are variables (`let`, `const`, `var`)?
    * What are the primitive data types (strings, numbers, booleans, null, undefined, symbols, BigInt)?
    * How do you declare and assign values?
2.  **Operators:**
    * Arithmetic operators (+, -, \*, /, %, \*\*)
    * Comparison operators (==, ===, !=, !==, >, <, >=, <=)
    * Logical operators (&&, ||, !)
    * Assignment operators (=, +=, -=, etc.)
3.  **Control Flow:**
    * Conditional statements (if, else if, else, switch)
    * Loops (for, while, do...while)
4.  **Functions:**
    * Defining functions (function declarations, function expressions, arrow functions)
    * Function parameters and return values
    * Scope (global, local)
5.  **Data Structures (Basics):**
    * Arrays (creating, accessing, manipulating)
    * Objects (creating, accessing, manipulating)

## Phase 2: Intermediate Concepts (Building Functionality)

1.  **DOM Manipulation:**
    * Selecting elements (getElementById, querySelector, querySelectorAll)
    * Modifying elements (innerHTML, textContent, attributes)
    * Event handling (addEventListener)
2.  **Asynchronous JavaScript:**
    * Callbacks
    * Promises (async/await)
    * Fetch API
3.  **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**
    * Objects and classes
    * Inheritance
    * Encapsulation
    * Prototypes
4.  **Error Handling:**
    * try...catch blocks
    * Throwing errors

## Phase 3: Advanced Topics (Mastering the Language)

1.  **Closures and Scope:**
    * Understanding lexical scope
    * Using closures for data privacy
2.  **Modules:**
    * ES Modules (import, export)
    * CommonJS
3.  **Advanced Data Structures:**
    * Maps and Sets
    * WeakMaps and WeakSets
4.  **Design Patterns:**
    * Common JavaScript design patterns (e.g., module, observer, factory)
5.  **Performance Optimization:**
    * Techniques for improving JavaScript performance
    * Memory management.
6.  **Testing:**
    * Unit testing frameworks (Jest, Mocha)
7.  **Modern JavaScript Features (ES6+):**
    * Destructuring
    * Spread/Rest operators
    * Template literals
    * Generators

## Getting Started

Let's begin with Phase 1, Step 1: Variables and Data Types.

**Questions:**

1.  What do you already know about variables in JavaScript?
2.  Have you encountered any specific data types before?
3.  What are your initial thoughts on the differences between `let`, `const`, and `var`?

This roadmap will be updated as we progress.
